# Problem list
For any point in the plane, the tangent is required from this point to a given type curve. If this cut line exists, the curve and tangent are drawn. If the tangent does not exist, it returns false.

## 1. Circle
A circle is given a circle, a circular center and a radius. For a known point in the plane, it is required to cut the point and cut the round tangent. If the cut line exists, the round and tangent; if the tangent does not exist, return false.

`Round standard equation`:
$$
(x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2=r^2
$$
$x_0$，$y_0$，$r$ is already known.

A known point $(x_1,y_1)$​​ is given, and the tangent of this point is required.

For a given straight line equation, $y=mx+n$. The discrimination of equations obtained after satisfying a round equation and linear equation is equal to 0. Nature of the tangential equation.
